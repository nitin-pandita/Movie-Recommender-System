# Movie-Recommender-System
Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning

A movie recommendation model using machine learning is a system that uses various data points to suggest movies to users. The model typically takes in data about a user's past movie preferences, such as movies they've rated highly or genres they enjoy, as well as information about the movies themselves, including their genres, actors, directors, and release dates.
