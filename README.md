<h4> Steps involved in the Model </h4>

- Data collection : Data is being collected from Kaggle "TMDB Dataset" which contains 5000+ movies dataset and has different fields in it.

- Combining the Data: In the dataset i was having two different dataset , one was for the movies and other one was for the credit, as i was not required to use all the data, so i extracted only useful columns that were required for the recommendation

- Data processing : After collecting the data , I looked for the missing values and duplicate values as the dataset was already preprocessed so it does'nt take me much to preprocess the data.
